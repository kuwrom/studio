# **App Name**: VideoScriptAI

## Core Features:

- Input Capture: A main screen that allows the user to either speak or type to input a video idea.
- Contextual Understanding: Using the speech or text input, the AI provides a short summary (title or one-sentence context) of its current understanding of the video's topic, updated in real time. This is performed by an AI tool.
- Script Display: A secondary screen, accessible via sliding gesture, to display the generated video script.
- Script Generation Trigger: A button on the secondary screen to trigger the full script generation.
- Script Generation: AI-powered generation of the full video script based on the summarized context from the main page, triggered by the generate button on the second screen. This is performed by an AI tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid purple (#A020F0) evokes creativity and imagination, befitting a script generation tool.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) to ensure readability and focus on the content.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) will guide the users attention, since this hue complements purple and creates contrast.
- Clean, sans-serif font to ensure readability.
- Focus on a clean, single-column layout with input options at the bottom on the first screen. A full-screen display for the generated script on the second screen.
- Smooth transition animations when updating the AI understanding.
